🛡️ AUMVION: The Unhackable Ecosystem

AUMVION is an autonomous, self-healing cybersecurity ecosystem powered by Generative AI.
It acts as a Digital Immune System – predicting, detecting, and neutralizing threats in real time without human intervention.

🚨 Problem

Traditional cybersecurity systems are static and reactive:

Once hackers exploit a weakness, it remains vulnerable.

Heavy reliance on human operators slows down response.

Data leaks, downtime, and financial damage are still common.
